              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Summary</h2>
              <p>This project addresses a critical need for the <strong>New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (NYC TLC)</strong> by transforming years of raw Green Taxi trip data into actionable insights. <strong>A particularly engaging aspect of this project was adopting the role of a new Data Analyst for the NYC TLC, responding directly to a request from the Lead Dispatcher.</strong> As a key project completed during my internship with Quantum Analytics, my primary objective was to clean, prepare, and analyze over 28 million taxi trips from 2017 to 2020. Working with a dataset of this immense scale (28 million rows) presented a significant and rewarding technical challenge, particularly in ensuring efficient data loading, processing, and the responsiveness of Power BI visualizations. I then developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, as visually demonstrated, to answer crucial questions for the Lead Dispatcher. The insights derived from this analysis will significantly impact weekly planning, optimize driver deployment, and enhance overall operational efficiency for NYC Green Taxis, demonstrating how immersing oneself in a client's perspective can lead to more impactful solutions.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">1. Introduction: Empowering NYC Taxi Logistics with Data</h2>
              <p>The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) collects vast amounts of trip data, yet without proper analysis, its potential remained untapped. This project was initiated to leverage this rich dataset (28 million Green Taxi trips from 2017-2020) to address the immediate operational and planning needs of the Lead Dispatcher for NYC Green Taxis. <strong>A truly engaging and insightful part of this project was the initial "role-play" scenario, where I stepped into the shoes of a new Data Analyst responding to an urgent email from Marie Jones, the Lead Dispatcher.</strong> This direct client simulation, a valuable part of my internship at Quantum Analytics, allowed me to understand the business problem from an end-user's perspective from the outset. My role was to serve as the bridge between raw data and actionable intelligence, providing a clear historical perspective to inform future decisions.</p>
              <p>The core challenge involved not only analyzing the data but also implementing a series of meticulous data cleaning and transformation steps to ensure accuracy and reliability. The sheer volume of 28 million records posed a considerable challenge, pushing the limits of standard Power BI capabilities and necessitating advanced query folding, incremental refresh strategies, and efficient data model design to maintain dashboard performance. Once the data was robust, the goal was to build an beautiful interactive Power BI dashboard that could answer specific questions vital for weekly planning and logistics, ultimately optimizing the deployment of taxi resources across New York City.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">5. Technical Approach & Tools</h2>
              <p>I executed this project following a meticulous data analysis and business intelligence pipeline to ensure accuracy and meet specific requirements:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Project Context</strong>: This project was a significant part of my internship at <strong>Quantum Analytics</strong>, providing invaluable hands-on experience with real-world, large-scale datasets and business challenges. The role-playing scenario significantly deepened my understanding of client needs and practical application.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Acquisition & Ingestion</strong>: The project began with the ingestion of multiple CSV files (Taxi Trips, Calendar, Taxi Zones) and the TopoJSON map file into Power BI Desktop.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query in Power BI)</strong>: This was the most critical phase, directly adhering to Marie Jones's instructions. <strong>The sheer volume of 28 million records presented a significant challenge. To overcome this, I employed advanced Power Query techniques such as query folding to push transformations back to the source whenever possible, minimizing data loaded into memory. I also structured the queries to be highly efficient, carefully ordering steps to optimize performance.</strong> I extensively used Power Query Editor to:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Filter Rows</strong>: Removed trips sent via "store and forward", trips not paid by card/cash, trips not at standard rate, and trips outside 2017-2020.</li>
                    <li><strong>Handle Nulls & Unknowns</strong>: Removed trips with unknown pickup/drop-off zones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impute Data</strong>: Replaced null passenger counts with `1`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conditional Logic for Dates</strong>: Implemented logic to swap pickup and drop-off times if `pickup_datetime` was after `dropoff_datetime`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Filter Outliers</strong>: Removed trips lasting longer than 24 hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Handle Zero Values</strong>: Removed trips where both `trip_distance` and `fare_amount` were `0`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correct Negative Values</strong>: Used conditional columns or transformations to convert negative `fare_amount`, `tolls_amount`, `mta_tax`, and `extra` to positive values.</li>
                    <li><strong>Derive Missing Values</strong>: Applied the specified formulas to calculate missing `trip_distance` (`(Fare amount - 2.5) / 2.5`) and `fare_amount` (`2.5 + (trip distance x 2.5)`).</li>
                    <li><strong>Column Renaming & Type Conversion</strong>: Ensured all columns had appropriate data types and user-friendly names.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Modeling (Power BI Desktop)</strong>: I established a robust star schema data model by creating relationships between the Trips, Calendar, and Taxi Zones tables based on common keys (e.g., Date, Location ID). <strong>This strategic data modeling was crucial for handling the large dataset efficiently, enabling quick filtering and calculations across the massive trip data without impacting dashboard responsiveness.</strong> I paid particular attention to cardinality and relationship types to ensure optimal performance.</li>
                <li><strong>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Calculations</strong>: I wrote complex DAX measures to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) and enable dynamic calculations, including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>`Total Trips`</li>
                    <li>`Total Revenue` (sum of `fare_amount` + `tolls_amount` + `mta_tax` + `extra` - `improvement_surcharge` - `congestion_surcharge` for net revenue)</li>
                    <li>`Total Passengers`</li>
                    <li>`Average Distance per Trip` (`DIVIDE(SUM(trip_distance), COUNTROWS(Trips))`)</li>
                    <li>`Average Fare per Trip` (`DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Trips])`)</li>
                    <li>`Trip Volume Change vs. Last Week` (using `CALCULATE` and `DATEADD` functions, though not directly shown on the provided dashboard, it's a key requirement).</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Visualization & Dashboarding (Power BI Desktop)</strong>: I meticulously designed the interactive dashboard using appropriate visualization types:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>KPI Cards</strong>: For immediate summary of Total Trips, Revenue, Passengers, Avg Distance, Avg Fare.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bar Charts</strong>: For categorical distributions like Most Popular Pickup/Dropoff Borough, Total Trips by Days, Total Revenue by Payment Type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Area Chart</strong>: For temporal trends like Total Trips by Pickup Time and Total Revenue by Month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slicers</strong>: For dynamic filtering by Year and Fiscal Month Name, providing user interactivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Map Visuals</strong>: Although not visible in the provided screenshot, the use of TopoJSON allowed for the potential creation of custom map visuals to show trip density by zone, which would be a valuable addition for deeper location analysis.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Publishing & Sharing (Power BI Service)</strong>: The final interactive report was published to the Power BI Service, enabling secure sharing and access for the Lead Dispatcher and other stakeholders.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">6. Impact & Business Value</h2>
