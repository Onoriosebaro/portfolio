              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">FMCG Supply Chain Optimization: Analyzing Demand Patterns</h2>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Summary</h2>
              <p>This project addresses a critical challenge faced by a leading FMCG company in their instant noodles business: a mismatch between demand and supply. I leveraged Power BI to analyze the demand patterns across different regions of the country. By transforming raw supply chain data into actionable insights, my goal was to enable management to optimize supply quantities in each warehouse, thereby minimizing inventory costs and potentially guiding targeted advertising campaigns. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of warehouse distribution, competitor presence, operational issues, and workforce allocation, all crucial for strategic supply chain decisions.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">1. Introduction: Bridging the Demand-Supply Gap</h2>
              <p>For two years, an FMCG company in the instant noodles sector has grappled with significant inventory cost losses due to a misalignment of demand and supply. Specifically, areas with high demand suffer from low supply, and vice versa. I initiated this project as the first phase of a broader consulting agreement to address this issue. My primary focus was to analyze demand patterns across various pockets of the country, empowering management to fine-tune supply chain strategies and drive more effective advertising campaigns in high-demand areas. The company provided a limited but comprehensive dataset to kickstart this optimization effort.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">2. Project Objectives & Goals</h2>
              <p>I structured this Power BI project with clear objectives to tackle the FMCG company's supply chain inefficiencies:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The East zone, despite having the largest proportion of warehouses (41.11%), has the lowest number of competitors (2K), suggesting a less saturated market or unique logistical challenges.</li>
                <li>Rural locations experience significantly more storage issues and breakdowns compared to urban areas, indicating potential infrastructure or management challenges.</li>
                <li>The North zone has the highest competitor presence (31K), but a very small percentage of the total warehouses (1.72%), potentially leading to intense competition for fewer company resources.</li>
                <li>A vast majority of distribution operations are concentrated in urban areas (91.85%), suggesting that rural areas might be underserved or present opportunities for expansion if demand exists.</li>
                <li>Zone 6 and Zone 5 are critical for retail shop coverage, accounting for a substantial portion of total retail shops.</li>
                <li>Flood impact is considerable across North, West, and South zones, necessitating robust flood-proofing measures and contingency planning.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">4. Dashboard Design & Key Insights (Based on Visual Analysis)</h2>
              <p>I meticulously designed the "Supply Chain Optimization for an FMCG Company" dashboard in Power BI to present complex supply chain data in an intuitive and actionable format.</p>

This disparity could signify untapped market potential in rural regions or highlight challenges in reaching them.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4.4 Interactive Filtering</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Zone Slicer</strong>: I implemented a slicer for "Zone" that allows users to filter the entire dashboard by North, East, South, or West, providing granular analysis capabilities for regional managers.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The dashboard's clean layout and interactive elements empower stakeholders to quickly grasp the current state of the supply chain and identify areas for optimization.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">5. Technical Approach & Tools</h2>
              <p>I followed a robust data analysis and business intelligence workflow using Power BI for this project:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Acquisition & Ingestion</strong>: I imported the `FMCG_data.csv` file into Power BI Desktop.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query in Power BI)</strong>: I extensively used Power Query Editor to prepare the data for analysis:
                  <ul>
                    <li>I addressed missing values and ensured data integrity across all columns.</li>
                    <li>I standardized textual fields like `Location_type`, `WH_capacity_size`, and `zone` for consistency.</li>
                    <li>I corrected data types for numerical columns (`num_refill_req_l3m`, `retail_shop_num`, `workers_num`, etc.) to facilitate accurate calculations.</li>
                    <li>I engineered new features or transformed existing ones as needed for visualization (e.g., aggregating counts for total warehouses, workers, etc.).</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Modeling (Power BI Desktop)</strong>: I implicitly established a star schema or similar optimized model, even with a single fact table, by ensuring appropriate summarization and relationships for measures.</li>
                <li><strong>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Calculations</strong>: I wrote DAX measures to derive key performance indicators and aggregate values, including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>`Total Warehouses = COUNTROWS(Warehouses)` (or `DISTINCTCOUNT` if Ware_house_ID is unique)</li>
                    <li>`Total No of Workers = SUM(workers_num)`</li>
                    <li>`Total No of Retail Shops = SUM(retail_shop_num)`</li>
                    <li>`Total No of Distribution = SUM(distributor_num)`</li>
                    <li>I created measures for total storage issues, breakdowns, and competitor counts by relevant dimensions.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Visualization & Dashboarding (Power BI Desktop)</strong>: I designed the dashboard with a focus on clarity and interactivity:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>KPI Cards</strong>: I used these for prominent display of total warehouses, workers, retail shops, and distribution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pie Chart</strong>: I illustrated the distribution of warehouses by zone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bar Charts</strong>: I effectively visualized storage/breakdown issues by location type, flooded warehouses by zone/capacity, and competitors by zone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Treemap</strong>: I showcased retail shop distribution by regional zone, allowing for hierarchical analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Donut Chart</strong>: I presented the distribution of total distribution by location type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slicers</strong>: I implemented a "Zone" slicer for dynamic filtering and drilling down into specific regional data.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Publishing & Sharing (Power BI Service)</strong>: I published the final interactive report to the Power BI Service for broader access and decision-making within the FMCG company.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">6. Impact & Business Value</h2>

                <li><strong>Optimized Inventory Costs</strong>: By providing a clear view of demand patterns and operational inefficiencies, the dashboard directly addresses the demand-supply mismatch, enabling the company to reduce excess inventory and associated holding costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Informed Advertising Strategies</strong>: Insights into demand pockets (derived from retail shop numbers and potentially refill requests, combined with competitor data) allow the marketing team to target advertising campaigns more effectively, maximizing ROI.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Operational Efficiency</strong>: The identification of areas with high storage issues and breakdowns (e.g., rural locations) enables focused efforts to improve infrastructure and management practices, leading to smoother operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Resource Allocation</strong>: Understanding the distribution of workers, retail shops, and distributors by zone provides a data-driven basis for allocating resources where they are most needed or where growth potential is highest.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Mitigation</strong>: The visualization of flooded warehouses helps in proactive risk management, allowing the company to implement flood-proofing measures or develop contingency plans for vulnerable warehouses.</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong>: By clearly mapping competitor presence, the company can refine its strategies to either compete more aggressively in saturated markets or explore less competitive zones for expansion.</li>
                <li><strong>Foundation for Future Analysis</strong>: This initial phase provides a strong foundation for more advanced predictive modeling and robust supply chain optimization as more data becomes available.</li>
              </ul>
