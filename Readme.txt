# Baro Monarch Onoriose | Data Analyst & Business Intelligence Specialist Portfolio Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio website!

This repository hosts all the code and assets that bring my online portfolio to life. This website serves as a central hub where I showcase my capabilities in data analytics and business intelligence. Here, you'll find examples of how I approach data challenges, from cleaning and transformation (ETL) to modeling and developing interactive dashboards.

My passion lies in leveraging powerful tools like Power BI, Python, and SQL to uncover meaningful insights and empower data-driven decision-making.
