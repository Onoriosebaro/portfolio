Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio website!

This repository hosts all the code and assets that bring my online portfolio to life. This website serves as a central hub where I showcase my capabilities in data analytics and business intelligence. Here, you'll find examples of how I approach data challenges, from cleaning and transformation (ETL) to modeling and developing interactive dashboards.

My passion lies in leveraging powerful tools like Power BI, Python, Tableau, SQL, and Excel to uncover meaningful insights and empower data-driven decision-making.

Feel free to browse the code, understand the website's structure, and most importantly, visit the live site to explore my work firsthand!
