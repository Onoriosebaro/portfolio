                      ---

                      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">3. Data Scope & Metrics</h2>
                      <p>The project utilized a rich dataset collected from various healthcare facilities through an IoT-based risk monitoring system. The dataset includes the following critical attributes:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Age: Age of the pregnant woman in years.</li>
                          <li>SystolicBP: Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg.</li>
                          <li>DiastolicBP: Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg.</li>
                          <li>BS (Blood Sugar): Blood glucose levels in mmol/L.</li>
                          <li>HeartRate: Resting heart rate in beats per minute.</li>
                          <li>BodyTemperature: Body temperature in degrees Celsius (though not explicitly listed in your prompt, it's often part of such datasets and useful for insights, if available).</li>
                          <li>Risk Level: The predicted risk intensity level during pregnancy (Low Risk, Mid Risk, High Risk) – this was the target variable for prediction.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Insights Derived from Data:</h3>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Blood Pressure as a Strong Indicator: My analysis revealed that SystolicBP and DiastolicBP were consistently strong indicators of risk. Patients with elevated blood pressure readings frequently fell into Mid or High-risk categories, underscoring the importance of blood pressure monitoring.</li>
                          <li>Blood Glucose (BS) Impact: Uncontrolled blood glucose levels also showed a clear correlation with increased risk. Patients with higher BS values were more likely to be classified as high-risk, suggesting the significance of managing gestational diabetes or pre-existing diabetes.</li>
                          
                          <li>Age and Risk Interplay: While age itself might not be a direct risk factor, the analysis showed that specific health conditions (like high BP or BS) tended to be more prevalent in certain age groups, indirectly elevating their risk. For example, older mothers might have a higher predisposition to certain conditions.</li>
                          <li>Combined Effect of Indicators: The dashboard allowed for the observation that a combination of moderately elevated readings across several parameters (e.g., slightly high BP, slightly elevated BS, and slightly irregular heart rate) could cumulatively push a patient into a higher risk category, even if no single parameter was critically high.</li>
                      </ul>

                      ---

                      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">4. Dashboard Design & Key Insights</h2>
                      <p>My Tableau dashboard was designed for clarity and actionable insights, enabling healthcare professionals to quickly assess a patient's risk profile. Key components included:</p>

                      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Dashboard Features and Insights:</h3>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Risk Level Summary: A clear bar chart or pie chart displaying the overall proportion of Low, Mid, and High-risk patients, providing an immediate snapshot of the dataset's risk distribution.</li>
                          <li>Parameter-wise Risk Analysis: Individual charts (e.g., box plots or histograms) for each key health parameter (Age, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, BS, Heart Rate), segmented by 'Risk Level'. This allowed for visual identification of the typical ranges of these parameters within each risk category. For example, higher median SystolicBP values were observed in High-risk groups.</li>
                          <li>Scatter Plots for Correlations: Using scatter plots to visualize the relationship between two parameters (e.g., Systolic BP vs. Diastolic BP, or Age vs. HeartRate), with data points colored by 'Risk Level'. This helped in identifying clusters of high-risk patients based on multiple parameters.</li>
                          <li>Interactive Filters: Filters for each health attribute and the 'Risk Level' itself, allowing users to drill down. For instance, a user could filter for patients with a Systolic BP above a certain threshold and observe their corresponding Risk Level distribution.</li>
                          <li>"Strongest Indications" Visualizations: Dedicated sections or charts were developed to directly address the "strongest indications" question. This might involve a bar chart showing the average value of each health parameter per risk level, or a trellis chart demonstrating the distribution of each parameter across different risk categories, making the most impactful indicators visually apparent.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>The dashboard's interactive nature allows for exploratory analysis, enabling users to hypothesize and validate which specific health conditions, or combinations thereof, lead to higher maternal health risks.</p>

                      ---
