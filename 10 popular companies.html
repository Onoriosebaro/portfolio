              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Insights Derived from Data:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Tesla show significant stock price growth and volatility over the 2015-2021 period, particularly Tesla with its high peak prices.</li>
                <li>Apple and Microsoft exhibit exceptionally high trading volumes, suggesting high liquidity and investor interest.</li>
                <li>Despite having high stock prices, Amazon and Google show comparatively lower total trading volumes than Apple and Microsoft, indicating different trading patterns or share structures.</li>
                <li>Quarterly trading volumes are relatively consistent, with Q1 showing the highest activity, which could indicate seasonal investor behavior or reporting cycles.</li>
                <li>The "Max of High and Min of Low" chart effectively illustrates that companies with rapid price appreciation (e.g., Tesla, Amazon) also experienced substantial price swings, indicative of higher risk but potentially higher returns.</li>
                <li>Walmart, a more established retail company, shows more stable and modest growth compared to the technology and electric vehicle companies in the dataset, reflecting different industry dynamics.</li>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">5. Technical Approach & Tools</h2>
              <p>The project involved robust data cleaning and transformation to handle daily stock market data, followed by comprehensive analysis in Power BI:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Data Acquisition & Ingestion: Daily historical stock price data for the 10 popular companies (Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Tesla, Walmart, Uber, Zoom) was imported into Power BI Desktop. Crucially, the data for each individual company was imported as a folder, and then all 10 separate company datasets were appended into a single, unified table within Power Query. The dataset included Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adj[usted] Close for the period 2015 to 2021.</li>
                <li>Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query in Power BI): Power Query Editor was essential for preparing the dataset:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Date Parsing: Ensured the 'Date' column was correctly parsed to a date data type, crucial for time-series analysis.</li>
                    <li>Data Type Standardization: Verified and set appropriate data types for numerical columns (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adjusted Close) to ensure accurate calculations and avoid aggregation errors.</li>
                    <li>Handling Missing Values/Inconsistencies: Addressed any potential nulls or irregularities in the daily stock price data.</li>
                    <li>Feature Engineering for Time Intelligence: Created additional time-based columns like 'Year' and 'Quarter' to facilitate aggregation and filtering by different time granularities, which are crucial for the dashboard visuals like "Total Volume by Quarter" and "Average Open by Year and Company."</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Calculations: DAX measures were created to compute key financial metrics and aggregations:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Total Volume = SUM('Stocks'[Volume])</li>
                    <li>Count of Company = DISTINCTCOUNT('Stocks'[Company])</li>
                    <li>No of Years = DISTINCTCOUNT('Stocks'[Year])</li>
                    <li>Measures for Max of High, Min of Low per company, Total Volume by Quarter, Sum of Volume by Year, and Average Open by Year were calculated. These often involved CALCULATE with ALL or ALLEXCEPT to correctly aggregate across different dimensions as needed for the visualizations.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Data Visualization & Dashboarding (Power BI Desktop): The dashboard was designed with a focus on clear and intuitive representation of global energy trends:
                  <ul>
                    <li>KPI Cards: For high-level summaries.</li>
                    <li>Company Selection Cards: Acting as visual filters for specific companies.</li>
                    <li>Area Charts: Effectively show price ranges and volatility (e.g., "Max of High and Min of Low by Company").</li>
                    <li>Bar Charts: Used for comparing volumes across companies and quarters.</li>
                    <li>Stacked Bar Chart: To illustrate annual volume contributions by company.</li>
                    <li>Line Chart: For visualizing average open price trends over time for each company.</li>
                    <li>Year Slicer: For interactive temporal filtering.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Publishing & Sharing (Power BI Service): The final interactive report was published to the Power BI Service, enabling wider access and sharing with investment professionals and enthusiasts.</li>
              </ul>
