              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Summary</h2>
              <p>This report details my data analysis project, where I focused on understanding and optimizing patient waiting lists within a healthcare setting. Utilizing a publicly available dataset from 2018 to 2021, my core objective was to transform raw waiting list data into actionable insights that could improve resource allocation, enhance patient satisfaction, and enable more proactive planning. Through detailed analysis and interactive Power BI dashboards, I illuminated key metrics such as average median waiting times and current total waitlists. I also provided granular breakdowns by patient category (Inpatient vs. Outpatient), specialty, and age profile. My findings aim to empower healthcare administrators to make data-driven decisions that alleviate pressure on services and enhance overall operational efficiency.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">1. Introduction</h2>
              <p>Long patient waiting lists are a pervasive and critical challenge within healthcare systems worldwide. They not only directly impact patient outcomes, increasing anxiety and potentially delaying essential care, but also strain operational efficiency and contribute to reduced patient satisfaction. Without robust systems for tracking and analyzing these wait times, healthcare providers operate at a disadvantage, struggling to understand historical trends, identify bottlenecks, and strategically allocate scarce resources.</p>
              <p>For this project, I addressed this challenge by analyzing a publicly available dataset on healthcare patient waiting lists. My focus was specifically on two distinct categories of patients:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Inpatients: Patients who are admitted and stay in a hospital for treatment.</li>
                <li>Outpatients: Patients who receive medical treatment without requiring hospital admission.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>By dissecting the dynamics of waitlists for both categories, my analysis aimed to provide a holistic view of the demand for healthcare services and pinpoint areas ripe for intervention.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">2. Project Objectives & Goals</h2>
              <p>I structured this project around clear objectives and actionable goals, designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the patient waiting list landscape:</p>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Overall Objectives:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>To track the current status of patient waiting lists: My goal was to provide an up-to-date snapshot of the total number of patients awaiting treatment at any given time.</li>
                <li>To analyze historical monthly trends: I aimed to identify significant patterns, seasonal variations, and shifts in waitlist numbers over time for both Inpatient and Outpatient categories.</li>
                <li>To conduct detailed specialty-level and age profile analysis: My objective was to uncover specific medical specialties experiencing high demand and to understand how wait times are distributed across different patient age demographics.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Project Goals & Deliverables:</h3>
              <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Current Waitlist Tracking: I developed a robust system within the dashboard to accurately track and display the current total waiting list, offering an immediate, high-level overview of healthcare service demand. The dashboard clearly presents "Latest Month Wait List" (e.g., 640K patients) against a "PY Latest Wait List" (e.g., 709K patients), providing crucial comparison points that I found to be highly insightful.</li>
                <li>Historical Trend Analysis: I performed in-depth time-series analysis on monthly waitlist data from 2018-2021. The dashboard visually presents the "Monthly Trend - Day Care/Inpatients vs Outpatients," showcasing fluctuations and highlighting key periods of increase or decrease, such as the noticeable rise in Outpatient waitlists towards late 2020/early 2021. This trend analysis was vital for my forecasting.</li>
                <li>Granular Specialty & Age Profile Insights: I executed detailed analysis to segment waitlists by medical specialty and patient age groups. The dashboard's "Time Band VS Age Profile (Average)" chart visually represents wait times across different age demographics (0-15, 16-64, 65+) and time bands (e.g., 18+ Months, 0-3 Months), while the "Top 5 Specialty" section immediately identifies specialties like "Paediatric Dermatology" (168) and "Paediatric ENT" (148), with high average waitlists, enabling targeted resource allocation, which was a key output of my analysis.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">3. Data Scope & Metrics</h2>
              <p>My analysis was conducted on a publicly available healthcare dataset covering the period from 2018 to 2021. This four-year historical window provided ample data for me to identify trends, understand seasonality, and assess the long-term evolution of patient waiting lists.</p>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Metrics & Insights Derived:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Average Median Waiting List: I calculated and visualized this metric to provide a representative measure of the typical waiting duration for patients. I chose this metric as it offers a more robust central tendency measure than the mean when dealing with potentially skewed waiting time distributions.</li>
                <li>Current Total Wait List: A critical operational metric providing the immediate number of patients currently on the waiting list. I prominently displayed this figure on the dashboard, alongside a comparison to previous periods, which I believe adds significant value.</li>
                <li>Case Type Split: The dashboard clearly quantifies the distribution of the overall waitlist by case type, highlighting that Outpatients constitute a significant majority (e.g., 72.49%), followed by Day Cases (e.g., 16.89%) and Inpatients (e.g., 10.62%). This breakdown was crucial for my understanding of demand.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">4. Dashboard Design & Key Insights (Based on Visual Analysis)</h2>
              <p>My project culminated in the creation of intuitive and informative Power BI dashboards, which I structured to provide both a high-level overview and granular analytical capabilities.</p>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4.1 Summary Page (Main Dashboard View)</h3>
              <p>The dashboard image displayed represents a well-designed summary page that I created, offering immediate insights into critical aspects of the patient waiting list:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Header Filters: I included prominent filters for "Calc Method" (Average, Median), "Specialty Name" (All), "Case Type" (All), and "Archive Date" (1/31/2018 - 3/31/2021), indicating user interactivity and the ability to drill down.</li>
                <li>Key Indicators - Patient Wait List (Average):
                  <ul>
                    <li>Total Wait List Comparison: I ensured this section clearly displays the "Latest Month Wait List" (640K) against the "PY Latest Wait List" (709K), providing an instant performance comparison.</li>
                    <li>Case Type Split: I used a doughnut chart to vividly illustrate that Outpatient cases dominate the overall waitlist (72.49%), followed by Day Cases (16.89%) and Inpatients (10.62%). This was a crucial insight for my resource planning recommendations.</li>
                    <li>Time Band VS Age Profile (Average): I designed a stacked bar chart to provide a detailed breakdown of average waitlist numbers across various age profiles (0-15, 16-64, 65+) and time bands (e.g., 18+ Months, 0-3 Months). This allowed me to identify age groups disproportionately affected by longer waits. For example, I observed the 16-64 age group showing a notable number in the "18+ Months" waiting band.</li>
                    <li>Top 5 Specialty: I included a concise list to highlight the specialties with the highest average waitlist numbers, such as "Paediatric Dermatology" (168) and "Paediatric ENT" (148), indicating areas of significant demand.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Monthly Trend - Day Care/Inpatients vs Outpatients: I used a line chart to effectively visualize the temporal trends for these categories. It clearly shows a generally stable trend for Inpatients and Day Cases, while Outpatient waitlists demonstrate a significant increase, particularly from late 2019 through 2020 into 2021, reaching 629K. This trend analysis was vital for my forecasting efforts.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4.2 Detailed Page for Granular Analysis</h3>
              <p>My project's goal included developing a "Detailed Page for Granular Analysis." This page would feature:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Further drill-down capabilities on specialties, allowing users to select a specific specialty and view its waitlist distribution across age, time bands, and monthly trends.</li>
                <li>More in-depth analysis of patient demographics or specific types of procedures contributing to wait times within each category (Inpatient/Outpatient).</li>
                <li>Potentially showing raw data or specific patient-level details (anonymized) to support operational decision-making.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">5. Technical Approach & Tools</h2>
              <p>I developed this project by following a structured data analysis pipeline:</p>
