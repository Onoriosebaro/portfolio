              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Summary</h2>
              <p>This project involved comprehensive analysis of over 5,000,000 commercial airline flight records from 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. The primary objective was to uncover key insights into flight performance, including delay patterns and cancellation causes. Working with a dataset of this magnitude presented a significant technical challenge, requiring robust data cleaning, transformation, and optimization within Power BI to ensure efficient processing and responsive dashboard interactions. I developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard (as shown visually) to answer critical questions about flight volumes, delay percentages, average delay times, and airline reliability. The insights gained provide valuable intelligence for understanding operational efficiencies and passenger experiences within the U.S. air travel industry, highlighting areas for potential improvement in scheduling and service reliability.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">1. Introduction: Deconstructing Airline Performance with Data</h2>

                    <li>Ensuring correct data types for dates, times, numerical values, and categorical data.</li>
                    <li>Creating calculated columns for delay minutes and percentage of delay, based on scheduled and actual times.</li>
                    <li>Parsing cancellation reasons to enable accurate categorization and aggregation.</li>
                    <li>Optimizing query steps to reduce load times and improve performance when working with millions of rows.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Modeling (Power BI Desktop)</strong>: A robust data model was established to facilitate relationships and calculations across the large dataset. Key considerations included:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Creating a calendar table if not already present, to enable time-based analysis (monthly, daily, weekday trends).</li>
                    <li>Optimizing data storage mode (e.g., Import vs. DirectQuery) and columnar storage for performance.</li>
                    <li>Establishing appropriate relationships between tables (if any additional lookups were created) to ensure data integrity and efficient filtering.</li>
                  </ul>

                <li><strong>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Calculations</strong>: I wrote complex DAX measures to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) and enable dynamic calculations, including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>`Total Departure Delay Minutes`</li>
                    <li>`Total On-Time Departures`</li>
                    <li>`Total Cancelled Flights`</li>
                    <li>`Average Departure Delay (for delayed flights)`</li>
                    <li>`% of Flights with Departure Delay`</li>
                    <li>Measures to categorize and sum cancellation reasons (Weather, Carrier, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Measures to rank airlines by reliability.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Visualization & Dashboarding (Power BI Desktop)</strong>: I meticulously designed the interactive dashboard using appropriate visualization types to address the project objectives:
                  <ul>
                    <li>KPI Cards: For immediate summary of overall performance metrics like total delays, on-time departures, and cancellations.</li>
                    <li>Bar Charts: For categorical breakdowns (e.g., Most/Least Reliable Airlines, Cancelled Flights by Reason) and monthly delay percentages.</li>
                    <li>Area Charts: For visualizing temporal trends like % spread of delayed flights from BOS and Total Flights by Pickup Time, allowing for easy identification of peaks and troughs.</li>
                    <li>Slicers: For dynamic filtering by Month, providing user interactivity and enabling deeper exploration of specific periods.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Publishing & Sharing (Power BI Service)</strong>: The final interactive report was published to the Power BI Service, enabling secure sharing and access for stakeholders.</li>
              </ul>
