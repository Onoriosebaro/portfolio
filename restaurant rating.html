              <p>The analysis leveraged a dataset containing restaurant ratings from Mexico in 2012, along with detailed information about restaurants and consumers.</p>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Data Source:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>2012 Mexico Restaurant Ratings Dataset</strong>: Includes information about restaurants (characteristics, cuisines) and consumers (preferences, demographics, ratings).</li>
                <li><strong>Key Entities/Tables (as inferred from dashboard content):</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>`Restaurants` (restaurant ID, name, city, state, smoking/drinking policy, pricing/budget, parking)</li>
                    <li>`Consumers` (consumer ID, city, state, preferred cuisines)</li>
                    <li>`Ratings` (consumer ID, restaurant ID, food rating, overall rating, service rating)</li>
                    <li>`Cuisines` (restaurant ID, cuisine type)</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Data Points & Metrics Captured and Displayed:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Restaurants</strong>: 130</li>
                <li><strong>Cities Covered</strong>: 4 (Ciudad Victoria, Cuernavaca, San Luis Potosi, Xalapa)</li>
                <li><strong>Total Consumers</strong>: 138</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurant Cuisine Types</strong>: 23</li>
                <li><strong>Top Rated Restaurants (Food/Overall/Service Rating)</strong>: 'Tortas Loc...', 'La Posada...', 'La Cantina...', etc., with ratings from 26 down to 11.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumers by City and State</strong>: San Luis Potosi (86), Cuernavaca (25), Ciudad Victoria (22), Jilutepec (5).</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurants by Smoking and Drinking</strong>: High percentage of 'No' smoking (78.84%) and 'Full Bar' (45.03%) for drinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Total No of Consumers by Budget</strong>: Medium (65.94%) is the largest segment, followed by Low (25.3%) and Not Defined (5.07%).</li>
                <li><strong>Total Restaurant by Cuisine</strong>: Mexican (13), Bar (9), Cafe (6) are among the most common.</li>
                <li><strong>Preferred Cuisine by Customers</strong>: Mexican (97), Cafeteria (11), Pizzeria (9) are top preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Total No of Restaurants by Price</strong>: Medium (46.15%) and Low (34.62%) price ranges dominate.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Insights Derived from Data:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>San Luis Potosi has the highest concentration of consumers in the dataset, suggesting it's a key market.</li>
                <li>The majority of consumers (65.94%) have a medium budget, indicating a strong demand for mid-range dining options.</li>
                <li>Mexican cuisine is both the most supplied (Total Restaurant by Cuisine) and the most preferred (Preferred Cuisine by Customers), indicating a robust local market. However, given the high preference, there might still be room for more diverse, high-quality Mexican restaurants.</li>
                <li>There is a significant number of restaurants with 'No' smoking policies (78.84%), aligning with potential public health trends or regulations.</li>
                <li>Most restaurants fall into the 'Medium' and 'Low' price categories, aligning with the majority consumer budget. This could signal a competitive landscape in these segments.</li>
                <li>Comparing 'Total Restaurant by Cuisine' and 'Preferred Cuisine by Customers' can highlight potential demand-supply gaps. For example, while Mexican is preferred, the number of restaurants aligns, but for other cuisines, a gap might exist.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">4. Insights and Analysis from the Dashboard</h2>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4.1 What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?</h3>
              <p>Top-rated restaurants like "Tortas Loc..." consistently achieve high scores across food, service, and overall experience, indicating that a holistic positive dining experience is critical for success.</p>
              <p>Consumer preferences significantly influence ratings. The dashboard shows strong preferences for Mexican cuisine and medium-to-low budgets. Restaurants aligning with these preferences, along with amenities like a full bar, are more likely to attract customers and receive higher ratings.</p>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4.2 What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?</h3>
              <p>The consumer base primarily originates from San Luis Potosi (62%), with significant proportions also from Cuernavaca and Ciudad Victoria. The dominant budget preference is "Medium" (66%), followed by "Low" (25%). Consumers also show clear preferences regarding smoking and drinking policies.</p>
              <p>Yes, the data exhibits significant geographic bias towards San Luis Potosi and a strong budget bias towards medium and low-income consumers. This limits the generalizability of findings, making them most applicable to these specific regions and budget segments rather than the entire Mexican restaurant market or high-end dining.</p>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4.3 Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?</h3>
              <p>Clear demand-supply gaps exist for American, Italian, Japanese, and Latin American cuisines, where customer preference notably outweighs current restaurant supply, indicating strong potential for new investments.</p>
              <p>Conversely, the "Cafeteria" cuisine segment appears somewhat saturated (more supply than demand), and the "Family" cuisine market is balanced. New ventures in these areas would require strong differentiation to succeed.</p>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4.4 If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?</h3>
              <p>For investment, I would prioritize:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Strategic Alignment: Restaurants aligning with the dominant Mexican cuisine preference (perhaps with a unique niche) or targeting American, Italian, Japanese, or Latin American cuisines to fill existing demand gaps.</li>
                <li>Budget Focus: A strong emphasis on the medium-to-low budget segments to cater to the majority consumer base.</li>
                <li>Performance & Experience: A proven ability to deliver consistently high food quality, excellent service, and a positive overall dining atmosphere to ensure top ratings.</li>
                <li>Location: Preferably in San Luis Potosi due to its high consumer concentration, or other cities showing strong consumer presence in the dataset.</li>
                <li>Amenities: Offering a full bar or wine/beer options would be a significant advantage, aligning with consumer preferences.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">5. Technical Approach & Tools</h2>
              <p>The project involved consolidating and analyzing data from multiple tables to build a comprehensive view of the Mexico restaurant market:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Acquisition & Ingestion</strong>: The dataset,comprising multiple CSV files (restaurants, consumers, ratings, cuisines), was imported into Power BI Desktop.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query in Power BI)</strong>: Power Query Editor was utilized to prepare and integrate the various data tables:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Table Merging & Relationships</strong>: Established robust relationships between `Restaurants`, `Consumers`, `Ratings`, and `Cuisines` tables using appropriate join types (e.g., `Merge Queries`) to create a unified data model.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Type Standardization</strong>: Ensured all columns were correctly typed (e.g., numbers for ratings, text for names/cuisines).</li>
                    <li><strong>Handling Missing Values/Inconsistencies</strong>: Addressed any missing values or inconsistent entries in restaurant characteristics or consumer demographics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Categorization/Grouping</strong>: Grouped similar cuisine types or budget categories where necessary for better aggregation and visualization.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Calculations</strong>: DAX measures were created to compute key business metrics and aggregations:
                  <ul>
                    <li>`Total No of Restaurants = COUNTROWS(RestaurantsTable)`</li>
                    <li>`Total No of Consumers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Consumers[consumer_id])`</li>
                    <li>`Total No of Cities = DISTINCTCOUNT(Restaurants[city])`</li>
                    <li>`Total No of Restaurant Cuisine = DISTINCTCOUNT(Cuisines[cuisine_type])`</li>
                    <li>Measures for average food/overall/service ratings, counts by city/budget, and cuisine preferences.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Visualization & Dashboarding (Power BI Desktop)</strong>: The dashboard was designed to provide clear and actionable insights:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>KPI Cards</strong>: For quick summaries of total entities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bar Charts</strong>: Used extensively for showing distributions (e.g., Consumers by City, Restaurants by Smoking/Drinking, Preferred Cuisines, Top Rated Restaurants).</li>
                    <li><strong>Pie/Donut Charts</strong>: For visualizing proportions like 'Total No of Consumers by Budget' and 'Total No of Restaurants by Price'.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slicers</strong>: For interactive filtering by City, Parking, and Consumer type.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Publishing & Sharing (Power BI Service)</strong>: The final interactive report was published to the Power BI Service for broader access and sharing with stakeholders interested in the Mexican restaurant market.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">6. Impact & Business Value</h2>
              <p>This Power BI dashboard for the 2012 Mexico Restaurant Analysis delivers significant value to various stakeholders:</p>
              <ul>

                <li><strong>Market Understanding</strong>: Helps existing restaurant owners and new entrants understand the competitive landscape, dominant cuisines, and consumer budget segments.</li>
                <li><strong>Operational Improvements</strong>: Restaurants can analyze the ratings of their competitors and top performers to identify areas for improvement in food quality or service.</li>
                <li><strong>Demand-Supply Gap Identification</strong>: By comparing restaurant supply (Total Restaurant by Cuisine) with consumer demand (Preferred Cuisine by Customers), the dashboard helps identify underserved culinary niches.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted Marketing</strong>: Insights into consumer demographics and city-specific consumer concentrations can inform more effective marketing strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Bias Awareness</strong>: Analyzing consumer demographics helps in understanding potential biases in the data sample, which is critical for accurate interpretation of findings.</li>
              </ul>
