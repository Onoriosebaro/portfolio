                      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">2. Dataset & Methodology</h2>

                      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">2.1 Data Collection</h3>
                      <p>The dataset for this research was collected through a Google Forms survey specifically designed and administered to a diverse group of university students. The survey aimed to capture self-reported data on various aspects of their academic and mental well-being. Key variables collected included:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Demographics: Age, gender, year of study, academic major.</li>
                          <li>Mental Health Indicators: Self-assessed levels of stress, anxiety symptoms (e.g., frequency of panic attacks), depression symptoms (e.g., feelings of hopelessness), and overall mental well-being score.</li>
                          <li>Academic Performance: Self-reported Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).</li>
                          <li>Lifestyle Factors: Hours of sleep per night, daily study hours, frequency of social activities, perceived academic pressure, and family support.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">2.2 Methodology</h3>
                      <p>My approach involved a comprehensive multi-stage process to ensure robust analysis and meaningful insights:</p>
                      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4">
                          <li>Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The raw survey data was extracted from Google Forms into a structured format (e.g., CSV). I then performed extensive cleaning, which included handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal based on context), standardizing text responses, converting data types as necessary (e.g., categorical to numerical for analysis), and identifying and addressing outliers to ensure data quality and consistency.</li>
                          <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial exploration involved generating descriptive statistics (means, medians, standard deviations) and creating basic visualizations (histograms, box plots) for each variable. This helped understand data distributions, identify initial patterns, and detect anomalies that informed subsequent statistical hypotheses.</li>
                          
                          <li>Data Visualization with Tableau: The core of the output involved leveraging Tableau Desktop to create dynamic and interactive dashboards. This encompassed connecting to the cleaned dataset, developing diverse chart types (e.g., bar charts for prevalence, scatter plots for correlations, line charts for trends, treemaps for distribution), implementing interactive filters and parameters for user-driven data exploration, and designing a clear, intuitive, and visually appealing dashboard layout to effectively communicate complex insights.</li>
                      </ol>

                      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">4. Key Insights & Dashboard Features</h2>
                      <p>The Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the research findings, allowing interactive data exploration. Key features and insights include:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Mental Health Status Overview: A treemap visualization on the dashboard clearly showed that "Moderate Stress" was the most reported mental health concern among students (35%), closely followed by "Mild Anxiety" (28%). This highlights a widespread need for accessible stress management resources.</li>
                          <li>CGPA by Mental Health Category: A bar chart comparing average CGPA across different stress levels revealed a clear negative correlation. Students reporting "High Stress" had an average CGPA of 2.8, significantly lower than the 3.5 average for students with "Low Stress." Similarly, those experiencing "Frequent Anxiety" averaged a CGPA of 2.9, compared to 3.4 for students with "Rare Anxiety."</li>
                          <li>Impact of Specific Factors: A scatter plot correlating 'Hours of Quality Sleep' with 'CGPA' illustrated that students consistently getting 7-8 hours of sleep tended to have higher CGPAs, with optimal performance peaking around 7.5 hours. Conversely, a stacked bar chart showing 'CGPA distribution by 'Study Habits'' indicated that students who felt "Overwhelmed by Studies" were disproportionately represented in the lower CGPA bands.</li>
                          <li>Demographic Analysis: Interactive filters on the dashboard allowed for detailed demographic breakdowns. A line chart comparing 'Average Anxiety Levels by Year of Study' showed a gradual increase in anxiety from freshman to senior year, with a notable spike observed in the final year, suggesting heightened pressure as graduation approaches. Further analysis using a pie chart indicated that female students reported slightly higher instances of anxiety symptoms compared to male students.</li>
                          <li>Interactive Capabilities: The dashboard incorporates various filters and parameters, enabling users to dynamically slice and dice the data by age group, gender, year of study, and specific mental health factors to gain granular insights.</li>
                      </ul>
