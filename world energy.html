              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Summary</h2>
              <p>This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of global energy consumption patterns, leveraging the extensive "Our World in Data" energy dataset. The dashboard explores various facets of energy use, including primary energy, energy mix, electricity mix, and country-level consumption. It incorporates data from key sources like the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, SHIFT Data Portal, and EMBER. The project involved crucial data alterations, such as standardizing country names, recalculating primary energy into terawatt-hours (TWh), and deriving per capita figures. Through interactive visualizations, the analysis aims to highlight global energy trends, identify major consumers and producers, and shed light on the evolving energy landscape to support informed decision-making for policymakers, researchers, and environmental strategists.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">1. Introduction: Understanding the Global Energy Landscape</h2>
              <p>Global energy consumption patterns are fundamental to understanding economic development, environmental impact, and geopolitical stability. The "Our World in Data" energy dataset provides a rich, regularly updated source for exploring these complex dynamics. This project harnesses this data to create a Power BI dashboard that simplifies complex energy metrics into actionable insights. By analyzing energy consumption by different countries, energy mix, and electricity generation, the goal is to offer a clearer picture of how the world powers itself, identify trends in energy sources, and provide a foundation for discussing sustainable energy futures.</p>

              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Insights Derived from Data:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Global energy consumption has significantly increased over the past century, driven primarily by fossil fuels (Oil, Coal, Gas), especially Primary Energy.</li>
                <li>The United States, China, and Russia are consistently among the top global consumers and producers across various energy types (oil, coal, gas, nuclear, primary energy).</li>
                <li>While renewable energy sources (Solar, Wind, Hydro) show exponential growth, particularly in the 21st century, their overall contribution to total primary energy consumption, while increasing, is still smaller than fossil fuels, indicating a continued global reliance on traditional energy sources.</li>
                <li>There is a considerable disparity between countries in terms of energy mix and consumption levels, reflecting different stages of industrialization, resource availability, and policy choices.</li>
                <li>Nuclear energy, while not growing as rapidly as some renewables, represents a significant portion of energy consumption in several developed nations like the US and France.</li>
                <li>The dashboard reveals opportunities for countries to transition towards higher renewable energy adoption, especially those with lower current renewable consumption relative to their primary energy needs.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">4. Dashboard Design & Key Insights</h2>

              </ul>
              <p>The interactive elements and clear visualizations empower policymakers, researchers, and the general public to explore complex global energy data, understand trends, and identify areas for sustainable development.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">5. Technical Approach & Tools</h2>
              <p>The project involved robust data acquisition, cleaning, and transformation due to the large scale and diverse sourcing of the "Our World in Data" energy dataset, followed by comprehensive analysis in Power BI:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Acquisition & Ingestion</strong>: The complete Our World in Data Energy dataset (CSV format), structured with one row per location and year, was imported into Power BI Desktop.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query in Power BI)</strong>: Power Query Editor was essential for preparing the dataset:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standardizing Names</strong>: Implemented transformations to standardize country and region names to the "Our World in Data" standard entity names, crucial for consistent reporting across different data sources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unit Recalculation</strong>: Recalculated primary energy figures from exajoules to terawatt-hours (TWh) using the specified conversion factor of 277.8. This ensured all energy consumption metrics were on a consistent and comparable scale.</li>

                <li><strong>Informed Policy Making</strong>: Provides policymakers and governments with clear insights into national and global energy consumption trends, enabling evidence-based policy development for energy security, climate change mitigation, and resource management.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Environmental Awareness</strong>: By visualizing the shift (or lack thereof) from fossil fuels to renewables, it raises awareness about climate change drivers and the urgency of energy transitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Investment Guidance</strong>: Offers valuable data for investors and energy companies to identify growth areas in renewable energy or traditional fuel markets based on consumption patterns and country-specific profiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic and Research Support</strong>: Serves as a valuable tool for researchers, academics, and students studying energy economics, environmental science, and sustainable development.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Management Strategies</strong>: Helps in understanding global resource depletion and consumption rates, aiding in long-term strategic planning for energy production and conservation.</li>
                <li><strong>Highlighting Data Expertise</strong>: Showcases proficiency in handling large, multi-sourced datasets, performing complex data transformations (unit conversions, per capita calculations), and creating impactful visualizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Collaboration Facilitation</strong>: Provides a common data platform for international organizations and countries to discuss global energy challenges and collaborate on solutions.</li>
              </ul>
