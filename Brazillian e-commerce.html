              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Brazilian E-commerce Data Analysis: Optimizing Delivery & Customer Satisfaction for Olist</h2>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Summary</h2>
              <p>This Power BI project delves into the Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset by Olist, analyzing over 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018. The dashboard provides a multi-dimensional view of order performance, focusing heavily on delivery status, customer satisfaction, and geographical sales distribution. Key insights include the volume of on-time versus late deliveries, monthly delivery trends, customer review scores, and identification of product categories most prone to late delivery. I meticulously cleaned and transformed the dataset in Power Query to handle complex relationships across multiple tables and ensure accurate reporting. My analysis aims to empower Olist and its sellers with actionable intelligence to optimize logistics, improve delivery performance, and enhance overall customer experience in the competitive Brazilian marketplace.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">1. Introduction: Understanding Brazilian E-commerce Dynamics</h2>
              <p>The Brazilian e-commerce landscape, facilitated by platforms like Olist, presents unique challenges and opportunities. Understanding the intricate details of order fulfillment, from purchase to delivery and customer review, is paramount for operational efficiency and customer retention. This project leverages a rich, anonymized dataset provided by Olist, encompassing 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018. The dataset's granular detail, including order status, payment, freight, product attributes, and customer reviews, demands robust data analysis to uncover patterns that can drive strategic improvements in delivery performance and customer satisfaction.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">2. Project Objectives & Goals</h2>
              <p>My core objectives for this Power BI project were to provide comprehensive insights into Olist's Brazilian e-commerce operations:</p>

              </ul>
              <p>The dashboard's intuitive design and interactive elements empower Olist and its partners to monitor performance, identify areas for improvement, and ultimately enhance the e-commerce experience.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">5. Technical Approach & Tools</h2>
              <p>The project involved significant data cleaning and transformation given the numerous tables and potential inconsistencies in the Olist dataset, followed by robust analysis in Power BI:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Acquisition & Ingestion</strong>: Multiple CSV files comprising the Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset (orders, order_items, products, customers, sellers, order_payments, order_reviews, geolocation) were imported into Power BI Desktop.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query in Power BI)</strong>: Power Query Editor was crucial for integrating and preparing the disparate tables:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Table Merging & Joins</strong>: Performed complex joins (e.g., `Merge Queries` in Power Query) to consolidate information from multiple tables (e.g., joining `orders` with `order_items`, `products`, `customers`, and `order_reviews`) to create a unified data model suitable for analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Date & Time Parsing</strong>: Ensured all date and timestamp columns were correctly parsed and transformed to enable time-series analysis (e.g., 'On Time Delivery by Month', 'Late Delivery by Days of the Week').</li>
                    <li><strong>Handling Missing Values & Inconsistencies</strong>: Addressed nulls or inconsistent entries across various columns, especially in product categories or review comments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Categorical Standardization</strong>: Cleaned and standardized categorical fields like 'Delivery Status' to ensure consistent reporting (e.g., categorizing into "On Time Delivery" and "Late Delivery" based on `order_delivered_customer_date` and `order_estimated_delivery_date`).</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Created new columns as needed, such as deriving the 'Day of the Week' from delivery dates for analysis.</li>
                    
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Calculations</strong>: DAX measures were created to compute key business metrics and aggregations:
                  <ul>
                    <li>`Total No of Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Customers[customer_id])`</li>
                    <li>`Total No of Sellers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sellers[seller_id])`</li>
                    <li>`On Time Deliveries = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(OrdersTable), OrdersTable[Delivery Status] = "Delivered On Time")`</li>
                    <li>`Late Deliveries = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(OrdersTable), OrdersTable[Delivery Status] = "Late Delivery")`</li>
                    <li>Measures for monthly delivery counts, orders by city, and late deliveries by product category and day of the week were developed.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Visualization & Dashboarding (Power BI Desktop)</strong>: The dashboard was designed with a focus on clear and intuitive representation for e-commerce performance:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>KPI Cards</strong>: Utilized for high-level summaries of customer, seller, and delivery counts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Line Charts</strong>: For visualizing monthly and weekly delivery trends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Treemap</strong>: To effectively show geographical distribution of orders by city.</li>
                    <li><strong>Donut Chart</strong>: For a clear proportion of on-time vs. late deliveries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bar Charts</strong>: Effectively compare late deliveries by product category and customer review scores.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slicers</strong>: Implemented for dynamic filtering by date range and delivery status.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Publishing & Sharing (Power BI Service)</strong>: The final interactive report was published to the Power BI Service, enabling stakeholders at Olist and its partners to monitor and improve their e-commerce operations.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">6. Impact & Business Value</h2>
              <p>My Power BI dashboard for Brazilian E-commerce Data Analysis delivers significant value to Olist and its ecosystem:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Delivery Performance</strong>: By identifying peak times for late deliveries (e.g., specific months, days of the week) and problematic product categories, Olist can implement targeted logistical improvements and communicate effectively with sellers.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Customer Satisfaction</strong>: Understanding the proportion of late deliveries and the sentiment of customers (even those without explicit reviews) allows for proactive measures to address common pain points and improve the post-purchase experience.</li>
