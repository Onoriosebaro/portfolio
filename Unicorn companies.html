              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Unicorn Company Analysis: Decoding Growth and Trends in the Billion-Dollar Startup Ecosystem</h2>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Summary</h2>
              <p>As my first Power BI project during my internship at Quantum Analytics, this dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of global unicorn companies. The project involved exploring key metrics such as total valuation, industry distribution, geographical presence, and the trends of unicorn creation and valuation over time. Through meticulous data preparation in Power Query and insightful visualizations, the dashboard aims to uncover patterns in the billion-dollar startup ecosystem, identify dominant industries and countries, and highlight the rapid growth of these highly-valued private companies. This analysis serves as a foundational tool for understanding market dynamics for investors, venture capitalists, and aspiring entrepreneurs.</p>

              <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">1. Introduction: The Rise of Unicorns in the Global Economy</h2>
              <p>Unicorn companies, private startups valued at over $1 billion, are key indicators of innovation, market disruption, and significant investment opportunities. During my internship at Quantum Analytics, my inaugural Power BI project focused on dissecting this unique segment of the global economy. The objective was to transform raw data about these companies into a dynamic and interactive dashboard, enabling a clearer understanding of their growth trajectories, the sectors they dominate, and their geographical concentration. This project was a critical learning experience in end-to-end data analysis within a professional setting.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Total Valuation = SUM(Unicorns[Valuation])</li>
                    <li>NO OF INDUSTRIES = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('unicorn companies'[Industry]))</li>
                    <li>NO OF COUNTRIES = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('unicorn companies'[Country]))</li>
                    <li>NO OF COMPANIES = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('unicorn companies'[Company]))</li>
                    <li>NO OF CITIES = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('unicorn companies'[City]))</li>
                    <li>Measures for calculating total valuation by industry, number of unicorns by country, and trends over time.</li>
