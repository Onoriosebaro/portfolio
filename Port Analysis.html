                      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Shipping Ports Around the World: Central Nodes of the Global Supply Chain</h2>

                      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Summary</h2>
                      <p> I undertook a comprehensive analysis of over 450 shipping ports worldwide during my intenship at Quantum Analytics. This project explored the evolving role of seaports, which have transformed from simple loading/unloading points into critical components of the global supply chain. My objective was to visualize and interpret data related to various port characteristics, such as automation, workforce skill, market access, and berth depth, to understand their significance in modern maritime operations. This analysis aimed to highlight the strategic importance of different ports and shed light on what makes a port a vital hub in today's global economy, including the concept of "smart ports" and inland facilities.</p>

                      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">1. Introduction: The Evolving Role of Seaports in Global Trade</h2>
                      <p>Seaports are the unsung heroes of global trade, facilitating the movement of an overwhelming majority of goods. Over the past few decades, their function has undergone a seismic transformation, driven by factors like the rise of manufacturing giants (e.g., China) and the increasing complexity of global supply chains. Today, a seaport is far more than just a harbor; it's a critical logistical hub, ranked by its efficiency, infrastructure, and connectivity. This project, conducted as part of my Quantum Analytics internship, delves into a dataset of over 450 ports worldwide to visualize and understand these changes. My aim was to illustrate how factors like automation, workforce skill, market access, and berth depth define a port's significance, and to explore the distinctions between traditional, smart, and inland ports.</p>

                      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">2. Project Objectives & Goals</h2>
